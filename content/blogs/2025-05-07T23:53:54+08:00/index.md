<!-- # Launching Ground Zero: My Embedded Linux & IoT Blog -->

Welcome to the first post of my personal tech blog — a space where I’ll be sharing thoughts, insights, and hands-on experiences from the fascinating world of embedded Linux, robotics, IoT, and beyond.

This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), one of the fastest static site generators, and styled using the elegant [Blowfish theme by Nuno Coração](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/). The full source code is available on GitHub, and the live site is hosted via GitHub Pages at jaydon2020.github.io/jiande.

To enhance the look and feel of the blog, I’ve chosen a tranquil and imaginative background sourced from [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/w/5gr5m7) and paired it with the dreamy, atmospheric digital art of [Matt Vince](https://www.mattvince.com/). His work—often inspired by *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*—captures themes of calm oceans, island life, and glowing sunsets that complement the exploratory, creative spirit of this blog.

## Why This Blog Exists

For years, I’ve tinkered with embedded systems, developed with Linux on low-power boards, and explored the fast-evolving world of connected devices. As my notes piled up and projects grew more complex, I realized how much value there is in documenting and sharing.

This blog will serve as:

* A personal knowledge base
* A reference hub for newcomers and professionals alike
* A way to give back to the tech community

## What You Can Expect

Here’s a glimpse of what I plan to post:

* Tutorials on embedded Linux workflows and development
* How-to guides on setting up IoT stacks, from bare-metal to RTOS
* Deep dives into tools, boards, and open-source projects
* Opinions, reviews, and rants from the world of connected hardware

## Changelog

**Version: V0.01.00**

* 🎉 Initial blog launch
* 🖼 Custom background wallpaper from Wallhaven
* 🧱 Built with Hugo + Blowfish theme
* 📁 Blog sections for Embedded Linux, Robotics, IoT, and Dev Logs
